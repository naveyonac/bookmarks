#Technology Stack
This application was made using a MEHN stack. That is, MongoDB, Express, Handlebars, and Node.js

#Dependencies
To install all of the dependencies required for this application, run "npm install" to directly install the entire list.

#User base
I created this app in hopes that it would be able to help organize myself. There are many times when I am searching around the internet and I find something interesting that I would like to read or watch, but its always at a time when I am busy working on something else or just don't have enough time to consume all of it. This app allows me to track all of these things in one place so when I get bored, I have a bunch of references to things that I want to view. It also allows links from anywhere, so you can have links to articles, or youtube videos, or even cat subreddits.

#Unsolved Problems
At this time I am having an issue with having the user log in and authenticating that they're an actual user. I would also like to be able to hash their password to make it more secure in the future.
